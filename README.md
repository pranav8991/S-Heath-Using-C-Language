# S-Heath-Using-C-Language
Ah, my very first programming project—the one that felt like climbing a mountain when, in reality, it was more like a small hill. 🏔️ It was back in 2017, and I was just getting my feet wet in C programming. Now, the assignment was simple: build a single-function project. Easy enough, right? Well, leave it to me to take a simple task and turn it into a coding saga.

Instead of diving into proper functions like a normal coder, I decided to take a “clever” shortcut. “Functions? Nah, I’ll just slap a bunch of printf statements in there. That’ll do the job.” Genius, right? 🤦‍♂️ So there I was, direct-printing everything, thinking I was some kind of coding prodigy. Efficiency at its finest—or at least, that's what I told myself.

The project, mind you, was supposed to take about an hour. But as someone who loves to tinker with projects, I naturally stretched it out over a few days. What started as a simple BMI calculator slowly transformed into a Frankenstein’s monster of health metrics, inspired by none other than the S-Health app on my Samsung phone. 📱 I was like, "Why not throw in calories? Distance in meters? Heck, let’s add more!” It was my version of a DIY health tracker, built entirely out of printf statements. 😂

The Program: A Glimpse Into My Early Coding Days
The project eventually turned into a body weight condition checker, a mini health tracker that calculated your BMI and categorized it. Here's the gist of what it did:

Compilation: To compile, just open a terminal and run:
gcc -o weight_checker 50.c

Running the Program: After compiling, just execute the following:
./weight_checker

Output: Depending on your input, the program will give you a detailed (and very decorative) response. For example:
>>Your body weight condition is normal !!

But I didn’t stop there. Over time, I kept improving it, adding new features. It may have started as a basic BMI calculator, but by the end, it was a mini health app in the making. And although it took me way longer than it should have, it’s a project I look back on with fondness. Sure, it was simple, but it was clever—at least by 2017-me standards. 😜
